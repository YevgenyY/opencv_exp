# What this repo is for?

Here I try and test different algorythms of great library [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

## Installing OpenCV 3 on Raspberry Pi ( jessie )

- Installing [Intel TBB library](https://www.theimpossiblecode.com/blog/intel-tbb-on-raspberry-pi/)
- Installing [OpenCV 3 itself](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)

## Very useful tool for creating samples for haar cascade training

Here is the [link](https://github.com/JoakimSoderberg/imageclipper.git) to imageclipper. 
You need CMake, OpenCV and Boost to build it.

```
imageclipper -f ./$i_%04x_%04y_%04w_%04h.%e AMBA1673.MP4
```
